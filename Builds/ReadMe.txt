The DiscordRPC is a quick way to use the program. it has an .exe file. which means nothing else 
needs to be downloaded (unless you don't have the .net framework)

The Installation wizard gives a wizard and installs the actual app on to your computer. (best)


DiscordRPC.zip will be for you if you're going to use it once.
The Installation wizard is for people who are going to use the software a lot more.


Thanks for downloading <3
